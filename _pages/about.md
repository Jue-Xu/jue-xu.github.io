<!-- My name is Jue Xu.  -->
I am a PhD student in CS at the University of Hong Kong.
 <!-- supervised by <a href="https://qizhao-quantum.github.io">Dr. Qi ZHAO</a>. -->
I earned a master’s degree in CS from the University of Maryland and a master’s degree in physical sciences from the University of Chicago. 
I was an undergraduate student of Fudan University.

My research interest lies in the fundamental interplay between physics and computer science. 
Currently, I am working on the complexity of quantum simulation algorithms and related problems.
I am also interested in the formalism of quantum computation.
Please feel free to email me if you would like to discuss any potential project.
